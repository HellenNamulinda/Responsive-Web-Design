# Responsive-Web-Design
This is a set of five web programming projects completed inorder for me to earn my Responsive Web Design certification from freecodecamp.org

By working on these projects, I got a chance to apply all of the skills, principles, and concepts you have learned so far: HTML, CSS, Visual Design, Accessibility, and more.

This certification required me to build;
1. A Tribute Page
2. A Survey Form
3. A Product Landing Page
4. A Technical Documentation Page 
5. A Personal Portfolio Webpage

All these have been designed to be accessible from a single page i.e the home page.
